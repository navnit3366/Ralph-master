Simple application that helps a user balance their checking account
At the end of the program when the user has finished entering in their data it will print out the list of transactions with the total. Would like to eventually like have a running counter that adds up the numbers and displays the current total while the user is inputting them before asking the user to input more data. Would also be nice if the program could push out the stored user inputs into a word document or something so that the user could print the data on a piece of paper to keep in their records. Any help or input would be greatly appreciated
